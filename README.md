Thyroid Disorder Prognosis System
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based system for predicting thyroid disorders, specifically hypothyroidism, using patient health data. The system employs different machine learning models to provide accurate predictions based on user input data such as hormone levels and medical history.

The system is built with the following features:

Thyroid disorder prediction using models like Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes.
Handling imbalanced data using techniques like RandomOverSampler to improve the quality of predictions.
A Flask web application for easy interaction with the system.
A recommendation system offering guidance based on the prediction.
A chatbot to help users understand the results and answer related queries.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/thyroid-disorder-prognosis.git
cd thyroid-disorder-prognosis
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the system by providing relevant input data through the user interface. Hereâ€™s how to use the system:

Upload Data: The system accepts health data for thyroid disorder prediction, including hormone levels (TSH, T3, T4), age, gender, and more.
Prediction: Submit the input to get predictions regarding potential thyroid issues like hypothyroidism.
Recommendations: Based on the prediction, the system provides medical and lifestyle recommendations.
Chatbot Assistance: You can ask the integrated chatbot questions about thyroid health and your results.
Model Information
The system uses two primary machine learning models:

Random Forest Classifier: This is an ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and merges them to get more accurate and stable predictions.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, especially useful for binary classification problems like diagnosing thyroid issues.
We handle imbalanced data using RandomOverSampler, which ensures that minority classes are adequately represented during model training, improving prediction quality.

Data
The system requires data related to thyroid function. Typically, the following features are used for predictions:

TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) levels
T3 and T4 hormone levels
Medical history related to thyroid conditions
Other vital stats like age, gender, and symptoms
System Features
User-friendly web interface: Built with Flask for ease of use.
Real-time predictions: Users can get instant feedback on their thyroid health status.
Recommendations: Based on the prediction results, the system provides personalized health and medical suggestions.
Chatbot integration: Helps users better understand their diagnosis and explore further information.
Future Enhancements
Additional Models: Exploring other machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning for better accuracy.
Expand Disorder Prediction: Include predictions for other thyroid-related disorders such as hyperthyroidism.
Mobile App: Create a mobile version of the system for easier accessibility.
Voice Input: Integrate speech-to-text functionality for easier data input.
